                Currently i am trying to learn the basics of web development by going through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">the odin project</a>!

                I am also starting on a new personal project for my portfolio, its a character made by <a href="https://twitter.com/squeakyart" target="_blank">Squeaky</a> named <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/XnWgJl" target="_blank">Glomi</a>. I think she has a very cute design!
                 my plan is to model her in 3D and then rig and animate her. I'm also going to implement shaders to her as much as possible in order to give her as much life as possible and to showcase my shaders skills even more! <br> If you wish to see my progress on her then <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeliotL">check out my twitter account!</a>
